description: Homework assignment on calculating the trajectory of a ball dropping
  and bouncing with no drag force, calculating the trajectory of a ball dropping and
  bouncing with Stokes? drag, calculating the trajectory of a ball dropping and bouncing
  with quadratic drag, and a bonus question on calculating a more accurate trajectory
  of the ball with a given spatial resolution.
