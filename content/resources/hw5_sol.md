description: Solutions to a homework assignment on calculating the factorial of non-negative
  integer with recursion, developing the algorithm for the solution of the Tower of
  Hanoi, solving the Tower of Hanoi with a recursive algorithm, and an optional problem
  on comparison between solving problems with and without recursion.
